Compile
=======
To compile from source you will need Java 7 and to install groovy and gradle.  I recommend using http://gvmtool.net/ for that.
Once you are set up, it will be something like:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bartoleo/GFlappyAsciiBird.git

cd GFlappyAsciiBird

gradle run
```

As GroovyScript
